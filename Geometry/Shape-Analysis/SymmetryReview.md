Niloy J. Mitra Mark Pauly Michael Wand Duygu Ceylan

EUROGRAPHICS 2012 State of The Art Report [paper](http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/Projects/SmartGeometry/symmetry_survey/paper_docs/symmetryStar_small_EG12.pdf)

A very good review for traditional symmetry detection method.

- Global vs partial symmetry
- Exact vs approximate symmetry
- Intrinsic vs extrinsic symmetry
