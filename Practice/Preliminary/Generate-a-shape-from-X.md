# Generate a Shape from X

### 1. Introduction to 3D digital content.

### 2. How to represent 3D shape in a digital platform?

### 3. Rendering 3D geometry to 2D media and browsing with local or internet graphics engine.

- Opengl : understand the rasterization and shading process

- Raytracing /& raycasting: understand how to get photorealistic image by traveling with lights.

### 4. Aquiring 3D content using Lidar equipment.

### 5. Approximate 3D content with a parametric function.

A simple shape autoencoder. Two examples:
- PointNet AE and 
- 3D GAN.

### 6. Generate 3D shape from images.

Modeling joint distribution of 3D and image data collections.
Examples:
- Disn
- Multiview 

### 7. Generate 3D shape from abstract design.

Sketch to shape; text to shape; audio to shape...

Examples of sketch to shape:
- SketchCNN
- DeepSketch
