# Shape Editing

### 1. How to represent 3D shape in the Riemann space?

Euclidean space versus Manifold space

Local coordinate system: Laplacian coordinate

### 2. A few notations of differential geometry and its explanation


### 3. Deformation matrix and the optimization function

Laplacian shape editing

### 4. Shape editing in latent space.

represent shape with a latent code, and deform the shape by moving the latent code to a new position in the latent space.

Examples:
- DeformSyncNet
- DualSDF
